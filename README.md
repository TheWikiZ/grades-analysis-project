## About
This is our group's Mini Project for SC1015/CE1115/CZ1115 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, which focuses on grades extracted from [student's performance on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/student-performance/data). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:
    1. [Data Cleaning]
    2. [Data Visualisation]
    3. [Data Sampling and Splitting]
    4. [Initial Model Observation]
    5. [Logistic Regression]
    6. [Random Forest]
    7. [Gradient Boosting]
    8. [Support Vector Machine (Linear)]

## Problem Definition
- Are we able to predict the grades of a student based on the different circumstances?
- If so, which model was the best in predicting the grades?

## Models Used
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Random Forest
  3. Gradient Boosting
  4. Support Vector Machine (Linear)

## Conclusion 
- (which model) is the best
- Blah blah
- Blah

## What we learned
- Blah
- Blah
